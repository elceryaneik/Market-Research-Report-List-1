<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fireproofing OSB Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fireproofing Additives</li><li>Fireproofing Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fireproofing OSB market comprises two main types: Fireproofing Additives and Fireproofing Coatings. Fireproofing Additives are substances incorporated into oriented strand board (OSB) during manufacturing to enhance its resistance to fire. These additives improve thermal stability and reduce flammability. Fireproofing Coatings, on the other hand, are applied as a surface layer on OSB products, creating a protective barrier against flames. Both types are essential for ensuring the safety and compliance of OSB in construction and industrial applications.</p></p>
