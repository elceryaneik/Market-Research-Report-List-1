<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urethroscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Flexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The urethroscope market comprises two main types: rigid and flexible. Rigid urethroscopes are designed with a stiff structure, providing excellent visualization and precision during procedures but may limit patient comfort and access in certain anatomical cases. In contrast, flexible urethroscopes offer enhanced maneuverability and can navigate complex urethral paths more easily, improving patient experience. Both types are essential for performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in urology, with choices often based on specific clinical needs and patient conditions.</p></p>
